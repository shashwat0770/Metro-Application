<h2>Welcome to the Metro Application project!</h2>

<h4>
  This application is designed to simulate a metro system using Java, incorporating various data structures and 
  algorithms to model and optimize the journey experience. The app allows users to view routes, check station information, and find the shortest path between
  two stations using efficient algorithms.
</h4>

<h3>Features:</h3>
<h4>
  Route Finder: Allows users to find the shortest route between two stations using algorithms like Dijkstra’s or A Search*.<br>
  Graph Representation: The metro system is modeled as a graph where stations are nodes and connections between them are edges.<br>
  Efficient Search: Utilizes data structures like Adjacency Lists, Priority Queues, and Hash Maps for fast route lookup and pathfinding.<br>
  Travel Time Calculation: Calculates the shortest time required to travel between stations, considering multiple factors such as transfer points and line changes.<br>
  Real-Time Updates: Simulates real-time updates to routes based on changes in the metro system (e.g., line closures, new connections).<br>
